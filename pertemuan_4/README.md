# 1. Intro to Object Detection Using Yolo
## 1.1 YOLOv1
- `Yolo (You Only Look Once)` V1 was introduced in June 2015 by `Joseph Redmon` et al.
- Creators of YOLO were motivated to design a `single stage CNN` that could be `trained end to end`, was easy to `optimize` and was `real-time`.
- Compare to R-CNN based object detection, the network was `hard to optimize` as well as `slow`. 
- `Yolo` Conceptual Design :
    - Yolo divides the image into an ***S × S*** grid
    - For each grid cell predicts ***B***  `bounding boxes` (*x, y, w, h*) with `confidence` for those boxes, and `class probabilities` (***C***). 
    ![](resource/yolo-pipeline.png)
    - These predictions are encoded as an
    ***S × S × (B ∗ 5 + C)*** tensor. 
    - General design Yolo architecture :<br>
    ![](resource/yolo-archi-general.png)
    - YOLO on PASCAL VOC, use S = 7, B = 2. with 20 labelled classes (C = 20). Produce tensor with size 7 × 7 × 30.
    
- `YOLOv1` Architecture :<br>
    - Network architecture is inspired by the `GoogLeNet` as a network backbone (feature extractor). 
    - Detection network has `24 convolutional layers` followed by `2 fully connected layers`.
    - The final output of our network is the 7 × 7 × 30 tensor of predictions.
    ![](resource/yolo-architecture.png)
- VOC 2007 `Error Analysis` for `Yolo` vs `Fast R-CNN`,
    - `Correct` : correct class and IOU > 0.5
    - `Localization` : correct class, 0.1 < IOU < 0.5
    - `Similar` : class is similar, IOU > 0.1
    - `Other` : class is wrong, IOU > 0.1
    - `Background` : IOU < 0.1 for any object <br>
    ![](resource/error.png)
- Pros: 
    - Quite `fast` (`~40 FPS` on Nvidia Titan Black)
    - `End-to-end training`
    - `Low Error Rate` for Foreground/ Background misclassification
    - Learn very `general representation` of objects
- Cons: 
    - `Less accurate` than Fast R-CNN (63.9% mAP compare to 66.9%) <br>
    ![](resource/map.png)
    - Can not detect `small objects` 
    - `Low detection rate` of objects that located `close` to each other
## 1.2 YOLOv2 (YOLO9000)
- YOLOv2 or `YOLO9000` was introduced at the end of 2016 by `Joseph Redmon` et al.
- YOLOv2 uses `Darknet 19 architecture` as a backbone with `19 convolutional layers` and `5 max pooling layers` and `a softmax layer` for classification objects. <br>
![](resource/darknet19.png)
- Inference Speed on Pascal VOC 2007 :
    - At 67 FPS, gets 76.8 mAP 
    - At 40 FPS, gets 78.6 mAP<br>
    ![](resource/yolov2-map2.png)
- Outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD. 
- Compare to YOLOv1, YOLOv2 becomes `better` (less error rate), `faster` (higher FPS) and `stronger`(9000 object categories with high detection and classification result).
## 1.3 YOLOv3 
- YOLOv3 was introduced in April 2018 by `Joseph Redmon` et al.
- YOLOv3 uses `Darknet 53 architecture` as a backbone with `53 convolutional layers`.
![](resource/darknet53.png)
- `Darknet 53 architecture` is a `hybrid approach` between the network used in YOLOv2 (`Darknet-19`) and `residual network (ResNet)`.
- `Darknet 53` built with `consecutive` 3x3 and 1x1 convolution layers followed by a `skip connection` (introduced by `ResNet` to help the `activations propagate` through deeper layers without `gradient diminishing`).
![](resource/yolo-v3-gen-architecture.png)
- YOLOv3 predicts boxes at `3 different scales`. 
- Extracts features from those scales using a similar concept to `Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)`.
- Taking the feature map from 2 layers `previous` and `upsample` it by 2x. 
- Also take a feature map from `earlier`
in the network and `merge` it with our `upsampled features` using `concatenation`. 
- This method `improve` network ability for detecting `small object`. 
- Detection tensor is ***N × N × [3 ∗ (4 + 1 + 80)]***, for the 4 bounding box offsets, 1 objectness prediction, and 80 class predictions. <br><br>
- Inference Speed :
    - At 320 × 320 runs in `22 ms` at `51.5 mAP-50` using COCO metric, as accurate as SSD but three times faster.
    ![](resource/inference-time-yolo-v3.png)
    ![](resource/yolo-v3-map.png)
- YOLOv3 is a good detector. It’s `fast` and `accurate`. 
- YOLOv3 is the last reseach by `Joseph Redmon` before he quite research on AI Computer Vision.
## 1.4 Yolo V4
- Yolo V4 was introduced in April 2020 by `Alexey Bochkovskiy` et al.
- But for now we won't get into this YOLO version.
